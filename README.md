# EECS_4312_Final_Project

## Project Description: 

ShoppersLand Inc. is the leading retail chain in Canada. We offer a large range of products including food,clothing, electronics, and pharmaceutical drugs. As a company we strive to provide the best shopping experiencefor our customers. We are continually trying to find innovative ways to help shoppers have a better experiencein our stores.We would like to develop an online system, i.e., SmartShoppers, to allow customers to find products in ourstores with greater precision than the current system. When open the system, the user will need to specify theirpostal code and/or their city and province. They will then be presented with a list of stores within their areato choose from as the location they will be shopping at. There should also be a feature which lets the user savethis store as their location for future use. The user should also be able to change the store location any timethey wish. The user should then be able to create a shopping list by searching for products and by viewing alist of sale items at the store they specified. An algorithm should then provide the user with the list in the bestorder in which to find the items, starting at the front of the store. Users should also be able to click on itemsto see a product description, price and where in the store it can be found. The user should also be able to viewa list of suggested items. This list would consist of products that others have searched for when they have alsosearched for items on the users shopping list.
